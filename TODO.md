# Todo list

## Stuff that needs doing
  * Warn the user when the inactivity threshold has been crossed.
  * Possibly use filetype instead of extension?
  * Add support for loading state from disk.
  * Save total session time as well?
  * Add a test-suite of some sorts?
  * Add support for multiple sessions in multiple vims.

## Done
  * ~~Make compatible with vundle structure.~~
  * ~~Write readme.~~
  * ~~Create custom filetype for stat display buffer for prettier output?~~
